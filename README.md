## Running Locally

1. Clone the project
2. Run NPM install from the project root:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Design decisions:

Limit countries to Canada, Mexico, China until I can get legal input on countries we can serve.

Use placeholder assets until I can contact design for real ones.

Use JSONForm to conform to company-wide standards
